Use 'npm start' in the project directory to view it in the developement
mode in your browser (http://localhost:3000/). 

On the login page the email is admin@admin.com and the password is admin (the Login doesn't lead anywhere yet)

This app also uses a JSON data base, to run the server use "json-server react-db.json --watch --port=5000" in the directory.
